# Longitudinal-NMF-identifies-the-altered-trajectory-of-motor-symptoms-in-Parkinsons-disease
This repository provides code for **Longitudinal non-negative matrix factorization identifies the altered trajectory of motor symptoms in Parkinsonâ€™s disease**.  
-------------------------
## Description  
The code of NMF section was from https://github.com/ondrejdee/hungarian/. The code of longitudinal-ComBAT section was from https://github.com/jcbeer/longCombat?tab=readme-ov-file. We here only provided the key code of XGBoost prediction section. By replacing the base estimators and mesh grid params, this code can be easly readapted to other different models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost and so on. The params in this code was only for reference.
